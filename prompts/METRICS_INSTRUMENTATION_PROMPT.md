Give me a plan to instrument this codebase with datadog metrics. 

Find the 10 most important methods. For each, emit three metrics, one for errors, one for latency, and one for request count. 

The plan must contain:
1. A list of the methods you plan on instrumenting, along with a one to two sentence explanation of why the method is worth instrumenting. 
2. A code snippet that outlines what you plan on doing to instrument each method. 

Put these in two seperate sections and write the plan to the prompts directory under the name METRICS_INSTRUMENTATION_PLAN.md.
